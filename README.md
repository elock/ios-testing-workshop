# ios-testing-workshop
A simple app created for the sole purpose of illustrating how XCUITest works for Elysia Lock's summer 2019 workshops

# Setup
In order to participate in this workshop, you'll need to have a machine running OS X Mojave. **_Make sure you download & install (or update, if appropriate) XCode prior to the start of this workshop._** Seriously, this takes half an hour or longer to download. Do it now so you can keep up with the class.

Once XCode is downloaded, clone this project. You can do that from within Xcode if you'd like, or you can use the command line:

```git clone https://github.com/elock/ios-testing-workshop.git```
